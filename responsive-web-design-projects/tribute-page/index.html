			<h3 id="headline">Here's a short summary of their epic:</h3>
			<p>On April 14, 1945, at 9 a.m., the attack on Montese began. Two platoons were sent towards enemy troops on
				the outskirts of the city, suffering heavy German resistance. The first managed to achieve its objective
				after a few hours and reached an advantageous position, while the second had its advance interrupted by
				a minefield and found itself entrenched among rubble against a constant barrage of enemy fire and heavy
				artillery bombardment.
				<br><br>
				Amidst this scenario of chaos, three soldiers from the second platoon, Arlindo Lúcio da Silva, 25,
				Geraldo Rodrigues de Souza, 26, and Geraldo Baeta da Cruz, 28, ended up playing a crucial role in taking
				the city and perhaps one of the most heroic acts in the history of the Brazilian Army. Upon seeing the
				desperate situation in the midst of enemy fire, and after seeing their commander die with a headshot,
				they ended up moving away from the fire zone and separating themselves from the rest of their group -
				some say that in an attempt to find a way out of the rest of the platoon, others with the intention of
				getting reinforcements.
				<br><br>
				The fact is that the three ended up, perhaps inadvertently, bypassing the approximately 100 Nazi
				soldiers who were shooting at their comrades. After positioning themselves at a strategic point, they
				lay down on the ground and began shooting at the Nazis responsible for the heavy artillery barrage that
				was slaughtering their colleagues.
				<br><br>
				The first was Arlindo, who, carrying an automatic rifle, practically unloaded six magazines on the
				astonished German fighters. The others soon followed, firing and throwing grenades at the enemies who,
				thinking they were facing another Allied platoon, immediately began to shout at them, ordering their
				surrender and returning fire. And so they stayed for a long time, taking the focus on the Germans from
				the rest of the Brazilian platoon, until at a certain point they found themselves out of ammunition and,
				according to many versions, they would have risen and advanced with their bayonets against the enemy,
				being shot down in the question of seconds: Baeta and Arlindo with clear shots, and Geraldo with
				shrapnel.
				<br><br>
				The Germans, upon discovering that they had suffered such a fierce attack by just three soldiers rather
				than an entire platoon, were astonished. The troop commander ordered that three graves be dug, and
				placed in them crosses that read “Drei Brasilianische Helden” – <strong>“Three Brazilian
					Heroes”</strong>.
				<br><br>
				In the meantime, the second platoon was able to leave its refuge and advance towards where the first
				platoon was, a more strategic position towards the enterprise of conquest of the city, where the rest of
				the German troops were concentrated. The next day, the Brazilian troops finally managed to neutralize
				all the Nazi artillery focuses on the city and managed to enter it once and for all. After a day or two
				of fierce fighting against the Nazi infantry, the little soldiers captured Montese for good for the
				Allies.
				<br><br>
				Montese's conquest was decisive for Operation Grapeshot to be successful. Along with other simultaneous
				offensives carried out by the rest of the Allies along the Nazi defense line, troops from other
				countries quickly managed to penetrate northern Italy and, weeks later, push the remaining German
				fighters back to their country for good, until the subsequent invasion of Germany
